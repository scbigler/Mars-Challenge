# Mars-Challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to scrape Mars-related data from https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html and perform some analyses.  Additionally, articles were scraped from http://redplanetscience.com, and the title and preview of the articles were stored in a list of dictionaries.
